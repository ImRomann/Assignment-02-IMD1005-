My client is Reyna Lamont, founder of LiveGreen products. Reyna had trouble getting all her vitamins, nutrients and all other needed supplements for her health, until she started eating health bars, then she got an idea. She thought that granola bars and everything like them were so convenient, she thought what if we could make a supplementvitamin bar that had everything someone would need throughout the day with different bars focusing on different vitamins needed. She created this product for those that are forgetful, don’t have time, or need a more convenient way to take all the vitamins they need.

The website is focused on being classy and simple to meet the needs of the clients, not being too flashy or extra but with enough flair and consistency that the buyers may be interested in the product. It starts with a home page then has an about page and a contact page. Each page contains details about the website.

The home page contains a hero card and some notes on the product, convenience, tasty and on the go, with quick descriptions and a picture as well.

The about section of the site contains an about section that has a quick description as well as some sub boxes about mission, values, testimonials, and history, as well as a bottom section that has a nice one liner and description as well.

The contact page has a box for name, email subject, and message and a send message or submit button at the bottom.

Any AI usage was listed inside the code, but I will restate here.

DESIGN CHANGES
There was quite a lot as for this assignment we aren't using just AI to create a website, it was still my design idea but on a smaller and simpler scale as I felt tackling a larger and more complex program wouldn’t be beneficial to me and would have me rely too much on AI possibly. So the sight is quite watered down but this is expected as a beginner programmer is much less intensive and well versed then a ai tool used for making websites. I also took advice on some of the design aspects and kept the website clean, colour consistent, and the image makes sense pertaining to the website.

MAIN PAGE.
For the image I was a bit lost on how to actually put the image in and then get it to be the size I wanted to be, I asked chatgpt on help with this section on the main page for getting the image in as at one point as well i tried putting in a downloaded JPG this did not work and I had to get an image off the internet which ended up working out well. I understand now that putting a jpg wouldn’t exactly work as other computers do not have access to the specific file
About Section
For the about section i had a question about the logistics of putting the larger “landing” card below the rest of the smaller cards on the page, originally when I did it, it wasn't centered and didn’t follow the CSS code I had written, Apparently it was a problem with the naming convention used and this was cleared up, a problem on my part as I changed the name without seeing,
Contact Section
I got chatgpt to help with me fix a part of code, it wasn't for the entire form section but simply one or two parts that I forgot to add an input type for some of the form groups that I was created, once again an oversight and it taught me to be more careful, it also gave me a better sense of the logic behind the forms.
CSS
The navigation list I got help with as well as the styling wasn’t working for the navigation list so I got Chatgpt to just simply explain some styling components and what would fit together nicely
As said before the image sizing and centering on the first page was a trouble for me so I got Chatbot to explain it specifically for an image as something I was doing was not working properly.
